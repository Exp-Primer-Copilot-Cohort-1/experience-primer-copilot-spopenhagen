// Create web server
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Create an instance of the Member class
const member = new Member();

// Get the member's skills
member.getSkills();

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
// This code will not work because the Member class and the getSkills method are not defined in the comments.js file. The code is trying to access a class and method that are not defined in the current file, which will result in a ReferenceError. To fix this issue, the Member class and the getSkills method need to be defined in the comments.js file or imported from another file where they are defined.
